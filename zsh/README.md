# Topic: zsh

## Category: shell

I don't like many-many ~/.dot-something-own files in my homedire.

## Description
* ~/.zshrc symlink - Only one symlink exists in my $HOME
* ~/.local/zsh/history - ZSH history is not shared between computers
* ~/.config/.zsh/.zsh/*.zsh - symlinks to enabled ZSH features
